# Learnings

<!-- Add entries as you go. Format: what you learned and why it matters. -->

<!-- Example:
[2026-02-18] Use `trash` not `rm`** — deleted a file the user wanted back. Always use recoverable delete.

[2026-02-19] Check timezone before scheduling** — sent a reminder at 3am because I assumed UTC.
